# PHP-Single-Page-Admin-Panel
This is PHP based very small size Admin Panel which may use to update website information like news, and navigation. 

### Usage
You can use this widget for websites that require minimum dynamic content with frequent update.
This is more secure and admin login field is hidden in “page not found” page ;)
You just need to change database credentials in configuration file (config.php)
Enjoy.
